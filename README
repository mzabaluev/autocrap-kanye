This is an example project to serve as a demonstration for
subproject inclusion capabilities of GNU autotools.
It is used as an internal subproject in a bigger testbed project,
autocrap-rocks.

However, Kanye packs a feature punch of its own. It provides an autoconf macro
to help its mother project share bits of its configuration. It is built as a
non-installable static library by default to accommodate its principal usage
as an internal module in the mother project, but offers an option to install
it into the system as a shared and/or a static library.

So you think you can do it better with a pile of makefiles, punk? Show me.

This example project attempts to showcase various features that GNU autotools
provide to developers at little or no implementation cost.

If you have checked this project out and you don't have the configure
executable in the top directory, make sure you have autoconf, automake,
libtool, and gettext development tools installed, and run:
./autogen.sh --no-configure

You can examine available configure options and environment variables by
running this command:

./configure --help

An incomplete list of features supported in this project's build files:

* Supports all GNU makefile and configure script conventions, such as
conventional directory location options and makefile variables, compiler
selection and flags, etc.

* Makefile rules automatically regenerate build files and rebuild all objects
after autotools control files are modified.

* Automatically tracks header dependencies for rebuilding.
Note: Sometimes it breaks the build due to added or moved files, but you can
fix it by running configure again.

* Can build in a separate tree for output files.

* The libraries and programs with interdependencies in the project are linked
and wrapped as necessary to run them directly in the build tree.

* With make install rule, the shared libraries are installed with relinking as
necessary for the destination directories.

* Substitution of configuration variables in installable files such
as .pc files for pkg-config.

* Supports l10n via gettext. If gettext API is not provided by libc, only
by libintl, it is automatically added to linker flags.

* Targets to regenerate the .po template file and update translation
files with changes of translatable strings in sources. When the list of
translated sources is updated, the template and translations are updated
automatically.

* Supports installation to DESTDIR so that distribution package maintainers
will love you.

* Makefile target 'dist' to create a distribution source tarball. Not everyone
is thrilled about picking out your sources from the SCM working tree
and bootstrapping configure with autotools as described above.

* Automatically picks up the project boilerplate such as README, COPYING,
AUTHORS, and includes it into the dist tarball.

* Supports a simple suite of test programs with coloring for test run results.

* Makefile target 'distcheck' to verify that the sources in the dist tarball
can be configured for a separate build tree, compiled, the results pass the
test suite, can be installed into a custom directory structure and DESTDIR
and uninstalled without errors.

* Supports cross-compilation if instructed by configure option --host.
Note: in this mode, don't forget to use option --build to indicate the build
system; this is needed due to problematic legacy behavior.

* All macros checking for build tools respect the cross-tools triplet prefix
in the cross-compilation mode. If the triplet-prefixed executable is not found,
uses the unprefixed name, warning the user.

* Supports a sysroot location for cross-builds, discoverable from a GCC-style
cross-compiler.

* Optionally builds static libraries.

* An option for non-verbose printouts of makefile rule execution.
